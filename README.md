## Network exercise

The objective of this practice is to recap the Network topic on AWS doing a VPC peering.
Let`s start provisioning two VPCs, both will contain a public subnet and an EC2 deployed on it. Create the VPC peering and make the proper configurations on the route tables. You should be able to ping from one instance to the other througth the private ip.
